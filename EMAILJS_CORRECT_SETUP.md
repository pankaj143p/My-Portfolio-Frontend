# ðŸ“§ Correct EmailJS Template Settings

## The Issue You're Experiencing:
EmailJS sends emails FROM your connected email account (your Gmail) TO your email, but includes the visitor's information in the content.

## This is the CORRECT and SECURE way it should work:

### Email Flow:
```
Visitor fills form â†’ EmailJS â†’ Your Gmail sends email â†’ You receive it
```

## âœ… Correct EmailJS Template Configuration:

### 1. In EmailJS Dashboard Template Settings:

**From Name:** `Portfolio Contact System`
**From Email:** `YOUR_GMAIL_ADDRESS` (the one connected to EmailJS)
**To Email:** `pankaj114477pankaj@gmail.com` 
**Reply-To:** `{{from_email}}` (THIS IS KEY!)

### 2. Subject Line:
```
ðŸš€ New Contact from {{from_name}} - {{subject}}
```

### 3. Email Content:
Use the HTML template from EMAIL_TEMPLATE.html, which properly displays:
- The visitor's name: `{{from_name}}`
- The visitor's email: `{{from_email}}`  
- Their message: `{{message}}`
- A reply button that goes to THEIR email

## ðŸŽ¯ The Key Setting: Reply-To Field

The most important setting is **Reply-To: {{from_email}}**

This means:
- âœ… Email appears to come from your Gmail (secure)
- âœ… When you click "Reply", it goes to the visitor's email
- âœ… You see all their information in the email content
- âœ… No spam/security issues

## ðŸš¨ Why You Can't Send "From" Visitor's Email:

1. **Security**: Email providers block spoofing
2. **Spam Protection**: Prevents abuse
3. **EmailJS Limitation**: They don't allow arbitrary "from" addresses
4. **Gmail/Outlook Rules**: They reject emails from unverified senders

## âœ… What You Should See When It Works Correctly:

### Email Header:
```
From: Portfolio Contact System <your-gmail@gmail.com>
To: pankaj114477pankaj@gmail.com
Reply-To: visitor-email@example.com
Subject: ðŸš€ New Contact from John Doe - Project Inquiry
```

### Email Content:
- Beautiful HTML template showing visitor's details
- "Reply to John Doe" button that opens email to visitor
- All visitor information clearly displayed

## ðŸ”§ Fix Your Template:

1. Go to EmailJS Dashboard â†’ Templates
2. Edit your template
3. Set **Reply-To** field to: `{{from_email}}`
4. Keep **From Email** as your Gmail address
5. Save the template

This way:
- Email comes from your verified Gmail âœ…
- Reply goes to the visitor âœ…
- You see all visitor details âœ…
- No security issues âœ…
